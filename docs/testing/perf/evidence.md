# Performance evidence: before/after per fix class

Row shape (every row): test → class → exact command → before wall/CPU →
after wall/CPU → L (with the companion command that produced L). Walls are
Class A focused runs unless noted; no wall is quoted from a profile run. Base
SHA for the before column: `da7abd7f` unless a row says otherwise. Each fix
change appends only its own section; the integration change is the final editor.

Focused command (quiet box, one discarded warmup, serial):

```
<time> go test -race -count=1 -timeout=0 -run '^<Test>$' ./<pkg>
```

`<time>` is GNU time with `-v`. `L` is the gate's printed calibration for the
run window (`L > 4` discards the run). Never pin `-parallel`.

## Baseline (survey)

Lens-F baseline walls for the measured set, at the base SHA above. These are
the before column for every fix-class section that follows.

| test | class | lens-F wall | user | sys | L |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FILL — 23 baseline rows |

Carried (not re-verified here; superseded by the measured column once filled):
retention test 243.6 s; #1 93.0 s; #2 91.0 s; #3 51.9 s; #4 48.2 s; #8 61.4 s;
#10 25.3 s; #11 19.3 s (all focused-and-alone, race, prior reference
measurement).
